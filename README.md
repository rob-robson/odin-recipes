The Odin Project - Recipes Task

This is the first "proper" project in The Odin Project.

The task is to create a website with various recipes. By the end of this project I should understand how to create the html "boiler plate", the basics of html and css and working with git.

At this point I have already completed a few html and css courses so this shouldn't be much of a problem!
